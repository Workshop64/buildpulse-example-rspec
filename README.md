# BuildPulse Example Project: Ruby + RSpec

This is an example [RSpec](https://rspec.info/) project demonstrating how to send test results to [BuildPulse](https://buildpulse.io) to help you identify and eliminate flaky tests.

## CircleCI Integration

If you have an existing RSpec project building on CircleCI, this [diff](https://github.com/Workshop64/buildpulse-example-rspec/compare/7d2004e...circle-ci) shows how to set up your `.circleci/config.yml` to send test results to BuildPulse.
